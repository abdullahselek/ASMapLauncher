# ASMapLauncher
ASMapLauncher is a library for iOS written in Swift that helps navigation with various mapping applications.

## Requirements

| ASMapLauncher Version | Minimum iOS Target  | Swift Version |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| 1.0.6 | 8.x | 4.0 |
| 1.0.5 | 8.0 | 3.x |

## CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```	
$ gem install cocoapods
```
To integrate ASMapLauncher into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
	pod 'ASMapLauncher', '1.0.6'
end
```
Then, run the following command:
```
$ pod install
```
## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```

To integrate ASMapLauncher into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "abdullahselek/ASMapLauncher" ~> 1.0.6
```

Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built ASMapLauncher.framework into your Xcode project.

## Usage

First initiate ASMapLauncher and check for a selected mapping application that installed on device
```
let mapLauncher = ASMapLauncher()
let isInstalled = mapLauncher.isMapAppInstalled(.here)
```

Then, launch selected mapping application
```
if isInstalled {
	let destination: CLLocation! = CLLocation(latitude: 41.0053215, longitude: 29.0121795)
	let fromMapPoint: MapPoint! = MapPoint(location: CLLocation(latitude: currenctCoordinate.latitude,
	longitude: currenctCoordinate.longitude),
										   name: "", 
										   address: "")
    let toMapPoint: MapPoint! = MapPoint(location: CLLocation(latitude: destination.coordinate.latitude, longitude: destination.coordinate.longitude), 
                                         name: "", 
                                         address: "")
    mapLauncher.launchMapApp(.here, 
                             fromDirections: fromMapPoint, 
                             toDirection: toMapPoint)
}
